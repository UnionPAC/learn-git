### Introduction to Git

**wtf is Git?** ü§î

Git is a Version Control System that tracks changes made to a codebase over time in a database called a **repository**.

### <a id="creating_snapshots">Creating Snapshots üì∏</a>

**Initializing a new Git repo**
`git init`: creates an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one

**Staging Files**
`git status`: shows the working tree status

**Committing Changes**
`git commit`: records changes to the repository

```
git commit [-a | --interactive | --patch] [-s] [-v] [-u<mode>] [--amend]
	   [--dry-run] [(-c | -C | --squash) <commit> | --fixup
[(amend|reword):]<commit>)]
	   [-F <file> | -m <msg>] [--reset-author] [--allow-empty]
	   [--allow-empty-message] [--no-verify] [-e] [--author=<author>]
	   [--date=<date>] [--cleanup=<mode>] [--[no-]status]
	   [-i | -o] [--pathspec-from-file=<file> [--pathspec-file-nul]]
	   [(--trailer <token>[(=|:)<value>])‚Ä¶‚Äã] [-S[<keyid>]]
	   [--] [<pathspec>‚Ä¶‚Äã]
```

**Committing Best Practices**

- Commits shouldn't be too big or too small
- Commit often
- As you reach a state you want to record **THEN** make a commit
- Make meaningful commit messages

**Skipping the Staging Area**
`git commit -am "enter commit message here"`

**Removing Files**

`git rm`: Remove files from the working tree and from the index
`git rm file1.txt`

**Renaming or Moving Files**

`git mv`: Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
`git mv file1.txt main.js`

**Ignoring Files**

A _.gitignore_ file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

- Sometimes a file or directory is already added to your project and cannot simply be ignored by _.gitignore_, in that case we have to remove the file from the staging area and then add it to our ._gitignore_ file.

üëá

**Git rm Options**
`--cached` Use this option to unstage and remove paths only from the index (staging area). Working tree files, whether modified or not, will be left alone.

`-r` Allow recursive removal when a leading directory name is given.

**Short Status**

`git status -s`: Shows a short format of the working tree status

**View Staged and Unstaged Changes**

`git diff`: Show changes between the working tree and the index or a tree, changes between the index and a tree, changes between two trees, changes resulting from a merge, changes between two blob objects, or changes between two files on disk.

`git diff --staged`

**Viewing History**

`git log`: Show commit logs

`git log --oneline`
`git log --oneline --reverse`

**Viewing a Commit**

`git show`: Shows one or more objects (blobs, trees, tags and commits).

`git show HEAD~1`

`git ls-tree`: List the contents of a tree object

**Unstaging Files**

`git restore`: Restore specified paths in the working tree with some contents from a restore source. If a path is tracked but does not exist in the restore source, it will be removed to match the source.

`git restore .`
`git restore file1.js`

**Discarding Local Changes**

`git clean`: Remove untracked files from the working tree

**Restoring a File to an Earlier Version**

`git restore --source=HEAD~1 file1.js`

### <a id="browsing_history">Browsing History üìñ</a>

**Viewing the History**

https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log

`git log`

_Options_
`--oneline`
`--stat`
`--patch`

**Filtering the History**

- Filter by latest commits

`git log -3` - This limits the number of commits to 3, starting with the most recent.
_note: 3 is just used for this example, but can be replaced by any number._

- Filter by author

`git log --author="Geoff` - Limits the commits output to ones with the author header lines that match.
_note: `--author` expects a pattern which will be treated as a regular expression.
So `--author="Geoff"` would also show commits by an author named Geoffrey._

- Filter by date

`git log --before`
`git log --after`

_Examples:_

`git log --after="2020-08-17"`
`git log --after="yesterday"`
`git log --after="one week ago"`

- Filter by subject

`git log --grep="GUI"`

_note: this operation is case sensitive_

- Filter by content

`git log -S"OBJECTIVES"`

`-S` Expects a _string_ and looks for differences that change the number of occurrences of the specified string (i.e. addition/deletion) in a file.

- Filter by range

`git log <commitHash1>...<commitHash2>`
_i.e_ `git log 91f7d40...1ebb7a7`

- Filter by commits that touched certain files

`git log helloWorld.txt`

_sometimes we'll need to seperate our file name from our options ... we can do that like this:_

`git log --oneline -- helloWorld.txt`

_note: if you use this space `--`, you must keep your options together_

_i.e_ `git log --oneline --patch -- helloWorld.txt`

**Formatting the Log Output**

https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#_pretty_formats

`git log --pretty=format:"%Cblue%an%Creset made commit %h on %cd"`

`%an` - author name
`%H` - commit hash
`%h` - abbreviated commit hash
`%cd` - committer date

`%Cblue%an%Creset` - changes the author name to blue and then resets the color to default

**Aliases**

- we can setup aliases for commands we use frequently

_Creating a custom git log command:_
`git config --global alias.lg "log --pretty=format:'%an committed %h'"`

_Custom command that restores all files in the staging area:_
`git config --global alias.unstage "restore --staged ."`

**Viewing a Commit**

There are two ways to reference a commit:

1. Commit Hash
2. Relative reference to the HEAD

`git show HEAD~2` - 2 commits before the last commit

- We can view the final version of a file in this commit like this:

`git show HEAD~2:testDirectory/test.js`

`git show --name-only` - show only names of changed files

`git show --name-status` - show only names and status of changed files

**Viewing the Changes Across Commits**

`git diff HEAD~2 HEAD` - shows all changes between these commits

`git diff HEAD~2 HEAD test.js` shows only the changes that happened to _test.js_ between these commits.

_Other Examples:_

`git diff HEAD~2 HEAD --name-only`
`git diff HEAD~2 HEAD --name-status`

**Checking Out a Commit**

- To go back to an earlier commit _(move our HEAD pointer)_
  `git checkout <commitHash>`

_Note: When in the 'detached HEAD' state we should not create new commits_

- To show all commits, even if HEAD is behind, we can use the option `-all`
  `git log --oneline --all` 
  
  <br />

- To attach the HEAD pointer to the master branch
  `git checkout master`

**Finding Bugs Using Bisect** ü™≤

Start using Bisect - `git bisect start`

Now we need to provide a commit that is bad, and one that is known to be good. This way we can start to narrow down where things went wrong.

`git bisect bad`

`git bisect good <commitHash>`


End our Bisect session, and attach the HEAD back to master - `git bisect reset`

**Find Contributors Using Shortlog**

`git shortlog`

https://git-scm.com/docs/git-shortlog#_options

**Viewing the History of a File**

`git log --oneline --patch file1.txt`

**Restoring a Deleted File**

`git checkout <commitHash> <fileName>`

**Finding the Author of Line Using Blame**

`git blame <fileName>`

**Tagging**

`git tag`

`git tag <tagName> <commitHash>`

- We can checkout a commit by using it's tag instead of it's hash like this:

`git checkout <tagName>`

To view all the tags we have created - `git tag`

There are different types of tags

1. Lightweight tags
	- A reference/ pointer to a particular commit

<br />

2. Annotated tags
	- contain a creation date, the tagger name and e-mail, a tagging message, and an optional GnuPG signature


To create an Annotated tag we use `git tag -a v1.1 -m "Some message"`

`git tag -d <tagName>` - to delete a tag

### <a id="branching">Branching üå≥</a>

**Working with Branches**

`git-branch` - List, create, or delete branches

**Create a new branch**

`git branch <newBranch>`
*ie.* `git branch bugfix`

**List branches**

`git branch`

- Using `git branch` will list branches and show what branch you are currently on. You can also use `git status` to check which branch you are on.

**Switch to a branch**

`git switch <branchName>`

**Create & Switch to a Branch**

`git switch -C <branchName>`

**Renaming a branch**

- We can use the `-m`or `--move` option to move/rename a branch, together with its config and reflog.

`git branch -m <oldName> <newName>`


**Deleting a branch**

- We can use the `-d` or `--delete` option to delete a branch.

*Note: The branch must be fully merged in its upstream branch, or in HEAD if no upstream was set with --track or --set-upstream-to.*

`git branch -d <branchName>`

- `-D` is a shortcut for --delete --force.

**Comparing Branches**

`git log master..bugfix/signup-form`

- this shows the commits which are in `bugfix/signup-form` but are *NOT* in `master`

`git diff master..bugfix/signup-form`

- this shows the differences between `bugfix/signup-form` and `master`

We can make this shorter by just writing `git diff bugfix/signup-form`

- This shows the difference between the current branch *(which is master in our case)* and `bugfix/signup-form`

`git diff --name-status bugfix/signup-form`

- this shows only the files which are changed between the current branch and the `bugfix/signup-form` branch

**Stashing**

Stashing takes the dirty state of your working directory‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâthat is, your modified tracked files and staged changes‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâand saves it on a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time (even on a different branch).

`git stash` - Stash the changes in a dirty working directory away

`git stash push -m "New tax rules."`

**View our stashes**

`git stash list`

**Show a stash**

`git stash show <id>`

**Apply stash on our working directory**

`git stash apply <id>`

**Remove a stash**

`git stash drop <id>`

**Merges**

Types of merges:

1. Fast-forward merges *( if branches have not diverged )*
2. 3-way merges *( if branches have diverged )*

**Viewing Merged and Unmerged Branches**

`git branch --merged`

- shows all the branches that have been merged into the current branch

`git branch --no-merged`

- shows the list of branches that have not been merged into the current branch

**Merge Conflicts**

A merge conflict arises when conflicting changes to the same part of a file occur in separate branches during a merge operation, requiring manual resolution.

**Graphical Merge Tools**

- Kdiff
- P4Merge

**Aborting a Merge**

`git merge --abort`

**Undoing a Faulty Merge**

We have 2 options

1. Remove the commit *(not recommended)*

`git reset --hard HEAD~1`

2. Revert

`git revert -m 1 HEAD`

*Resetting Options*

**1. soft**

A soft reset resets the branch's HEAD pointer to a specific commit while keeping the changes from the commits that were reset. The changes are staged for a new commit.

**2. mixed**

A mixed reset (also known as the default reset) resets the branch's HEAD pointer to a specific commit and also resets the staging area, effectively unstaging any changes. The changes are preserved in the working directory, allowing you to make new staging choices.

**3. hard**

A hard reset resets the branch's HEAD pointer to a specific commit, completely discarding any changes and removing them from both the staging area and the working directory. It effectively reverts your working directory to the state of the chosen commit.

**Squash Merging**

`git merge --squash <branchName>`

**Rebasing**

Rebasing is a Git operation used to integrate changes from one branch onto another by moving, or replaying, the commits of one branch on top of another. Unlike merging, which creates a new commit that has two parent commits, a rebase creates a linear sequence of commits.

However, it's important to note that while rebasing can create a cleaner history, it can also rewrite commit history, potentially causing problems for collaborators if not used carefully. Rewriting history can be problematic if others have based their work on the original branch, as it can lead to confusion and conflicts.

**Cherry Picking**

Cherry picking allows you to select and apply specific commits from one branch to another. It enables you to pick individual commits and apply them to a different branch, essentially "cherry-picking" the changes you want without merging the entire branch.

`git cherry-pick <commitHash>`


### <a id="collaboration">Collaboration üë•</a>

**Fetching**

`git fetch <remote> <branchName>`

- *if branchName is excluded it will fetch all the commits*
- *if remote is excluded, by default it will fetch origin*

`git branch -vv`

- shows how our local and remote branch are diverging

In summary, `git fetch` retrieves new commits and updates branch information from a remote repository **without** automatically merging them into your local branches.

**Pulling**

Whereas `git pull` is a command used to fetch new commits from a remote repository **and** automatically merge them into your current local branch. *It combines the actions of git fetch and git merge in a single step.*

**Pushing**

 `git push` is a command used to upload your local commits and changes to a remote repository, updating its branches and history to match your local repository. This allows you to share your work and collaborate with others by making your changes available to them.

 **Sharing Tags**

 To push tags to a remote git repo: `git push origin <tagName>`

 To delete tags from a remote git repo: `git push origin --delete <tagName>`

 **Sharing Branches**

 By default our branches are local.

 We can push our branches like this: `git push -u origin <branchName>`

 We can delete a remote branch like this: `git push -d origin <branchName>`

 **Pull Requests**

 A pull request (PR) is a request made by a developer in a Git-based version control system, such as GitHub or GitLab, to merge the changes from one branch (often a feature or bug-fix branch) into another branch (typically the main development branch). Pull requests facilitate code review, collaboration, and the controlled integration of changes, allowing team members to discuss, review, and approve modifications before they are merged into the main codebase.
